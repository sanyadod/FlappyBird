# flappy_bird
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the yellow bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player presses the spacebar or the up key. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.Â
